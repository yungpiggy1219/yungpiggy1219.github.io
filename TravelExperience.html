          <h2>/Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The advent of digital tools and smart devices has fundamentally transformed travel experience documenting
            process. Traditionally, individuals organized mementos earned or generated during a trip into physical
            collections like scrapbooks containing photos, postcards, and souvenirs to capture and relive their
            memories. In today's digital era, the landscape has evolved, and many have shifted towards utilizing digital
            album app or writing a blog online to document their travel experiences. Research suggests that users of
            travel apps often prioritize enjoyment over convenience and value satisfaction responses over mood
            performance (Lee et al.). In the digital era, where many tasks are digitized for convenience, individuals
            find sharing travel content enjoyable and aligned with their personally meaningful goals (Oliveira et al.).
            Nonetheless, virtual tourism products, primarily offering tours with pictures and information, face
            challenges in delivering fulfilling and memorable tourism experiences (Wolf et al.).

          <p>
            With the digital transition in travel documentation, it's crucial to evaluate existing solutions to ensure
            they meet
            users' needs. This study aims to explore the current landscape of digital travel documentation and assess
            whether
            available 'digital album' applications align with users' expectations. By identifying gaps and areas for
            improvement,
            the goal is to inform the design of a new product that caters to the evolving needs and preferences of
            individuals
            documenting their travel experiences in the digital age. Specifically, the study seeks to:

                their
                goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                To learn whether individuals prefer "enjoyment" over "convenience" in the process of documenting their

          <h2>/Findings</h2>
          <p>
            All participants in the study unanimously defined taking photos as a means of documenting their travels.
            Additionally,
            the majority of participants expressed a belief that printed photographs evoke stronger emotions compared to
            digital
            photos. Despite this preference, most participants indicated satisfaction with current solutions for
            managing their
            travel photos. Interestingly, several participants spontaneously mentioned the idea of a world map in
            relation to their
            travel experiences, indicating its significance in their perception of travel documentation or memory
            preservation.

            <span style="color: #EF4B7D; font-style: italic;">“I think taking pictures is very important to me.” -
              P01</span>
            <p>
              In terms of travel documentation, various mediums like photos, videos, text, and itineraries itselves are
              crucial for
              capturing and preserving memories. All participants see photos as their main trip memories. For many
              travelers, taking
              photos becomes an essential part of the travel experience, freezing a moment that captures the essence of
              the journey.
              However, despite the effort to capture these moments, some participants stated they never look back at
              their
              photos or
              other documentation, indicating that this behavior reflects something significant about people's attitudes
              towards
              travel and their engagement with memories.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>- Most participants are satisfied with current solutions</h5>
            <span style="color: #EF4B7D; font-style: italic;">“Phones and computers are more convenient.” - P02</span>
            <p>
              Most participants find using phones and computers for storing and organizing digital photos more
              convenient than dealing
              with physical prints. Many express satisfaction with the current digital solutions, Google Photos or Apple
              Photos,
              emphasizing the ease and immediacy of accessing their photos on electronic devices. They appreciate the
              convenience and
              cost-effectiveness of digital storage, as it eliminates the need for physical storage space and reduces
              the risk of
              damage or loss associated with printed photographs. Despite this convenience, some participants also
              recognize the
              advantages of physical prints, noting that while they require more effort to maintain, they offer a
              tactile experience
              and a sense of authenticity. Nonetheless, the overall feedback suggests a preference for digital solutions
              due to their
              convenience and practicality in storing and organizing large collections of photos.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h5>- Printed photographs evoke stronger emotions</h5>
            <span style="color: #EF4B7D; font-style: italic;">“Prints are more lively.” - P04</span>
            <p>
              Some participants believe printed photos evoke stronger emotions than digital ones, likely due to their
              tangible nature,
              offering a tactile experience and a sense of nostalgia and authenticity. The permanence of printed photos
              also adds
              emotional weight, serving as enduring mementos of cherished memories.

            </h5>
            <span style="color: #EF4B7D; font-style: italic;">“I want to buy a world map and a lot of pins.” -
              P01</span>
            <p>
              Several participants expressed a desire to purchase a world map, indicating a strong interest in visually
              documenting
              their travel experiences. For these individuals, the world map serves as a tangible representation of
              their global
              adventures, allowing them to mark each visited destination with a pin. Interestingly, while some
              participants insisted
              on acquiring a physical world map, citing a preference for the tactile experience it offers, others were
              more flexible,
              acknowledging the constraints of space and effort and expressing a willingness to accept a digital
              alternative.
              Regardless of their preference for the medium, the common thread among participants is the recognition of
              the world map
              as a meaningful tool for tracking and reminiscing about their travels, embodying a sense of wanderlust and
              adventure.

          <h2>/Discussion & implications</h2>
          <p>
            Considering that most users already utilize system default photo apps or services like Google Photos for
            storing and
            organizing their travel photos and already satisfied with this solution, it may not be practical to develop
            a new
            standalone photo app. Instead, focusing on enhancing existing platforms or offering complementary features
            through a
            virtual world map app could be more effective. This approach leverages users' existing behaviors and
            preferences while
            providing additional value through innovative features tailored to the travel experience. Therefore, while
            the research
            findings suggest the potential for a virtual world map app with integrated features, careful consideration
            of market
            dynamics and user habits should inform the product development strategy.
          </p>
          <p>Beyond merely serving as documentation of travel experiences, the act of taking photos itself is an
            integral component
            of the travel experience for many individuals. This observation suggests a fascinating aspect of human
            behavior worth
            exploring in depth. While photos capture moments and memories, the act of taking them also shapes the travel
            experience
            itself. Understanding why people feel compelled to take photos, even if they may not revisit them afterward,
            is an
            intriguing phenomenon that speaks to the intersection of technology, psychology, and culture in modern
            society. Diving
            deeper into this aspect can offer valuable insights into the motivations and behaviors of travelers,
            shedding light on
            the underlying reasons behind our desire to capture and preserve moments from our journeys.
          </p>
          <p>The contrast between the perceived convenience of digital media and the emotional depth evoked by physical
            artifacts in
            travel documentation offers valuable insights into users' preferences and behaviors. This highlights the
            complexity of
            human interaction with technology and the importance of addressing both practical and emotional needs in the
            design of
            travel documentation platforms. Moving forward, there is potential for the development of hybrid solutions
            that harness
            the efficiency of digital platforms while incorporating elements that evoke emotional connections akin to
            physical
            items. Additionally, future efforts could focus on enhancing personalization features within digital
            platforms and
            conducting further research to understand the underlying mechanisms driving emotional engagement with
            different media
            formats. By embracing this nuanced understanding of user behavior and preferences, designers and developers
            can create
            more holistic and satisfying experiences that cater to the diverse needs of travelers in the digital age.

          <h2>/Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            One limitation of this research is the insufficient depth of exploration resulting from not asking enough
            follow-up
            questions. During the analysis process, it became apparent that the study's limitations included a lack of
            follow-up
            questions. This realization highlights the importance of thorough questioning to uncover deeper insights
            within
            participants' responses. Without adequate follow-up inquiries, the depth of understanding and richness of
            data collected
            is compromised. Consequently, while the study provides valuable insights, the absence of comprehensive

            If further research were to be conducted, several recommendations could be considered:
          </p>
          <div>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Dive Deep into Understanding the Differences between Physical and Digital Media: </b>This could
                involve exploring factors
                such as sensory engagement, nostalgic triggers, and psychological associations to gain a more detailed
                understanding of
                why individuals perceive emotional differences between physical and digital forms of travel
                documentation.
              </li>
              <li><b>Evaluate the Desirability of a Digital World Map App: </b>This could involve conducting user
                surveys
                or usability testing to
                assess user preferences, expectations, and desired features for such an app.
              </li>
              <li><b>Learn Why People Take Photos and Never Look at Them Again:</b> By gaining a deeper understanding of
                why
                people take photos
                and their subsequent engagement with them, researchers can identify opportunities to enhance the value
                and
                meaningfulness of travel documentation for users.</li>

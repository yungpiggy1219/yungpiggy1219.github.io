            <h2>/Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              This proposed Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research seeks to
              address a critical gap in our understanding of therapeutic
              interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by exploring the
              potential benefits of video games. Grounded in cognitive
              psychology, this investigation aims to unravel the cognitive and
              psychological dimensions of individuals coping with AD. While
              cognitive stimulation has emerged as a promising
              non-pharmacological intervention, the role of video games in this
              context remains underexplored. Alzheimer's disease, characterized
              by progressive neurodegeneration, results in severe memory
              impairment and cognitive decline. As its prevalence rises with the
              aging global population, there is an urgent need to
              comprehensively address the multifaceted challenges it poses to
              individuals and society.
            </p>

            <p>
              The spectrum of cognitive decline associated with AD includes
              disruptions in memory, attention, executive functions, and overall
              cognitive abilities. Motivated by the pressing need for effective
              interventions, the exploration of video games as a cognitive
              therapy tool aligns with the growing interest in
              non-pharmacological approaches. The objective is to uncover the
              potential efficacy of video game-based interventions in enhancing
              memory retention, and overall well-being for individuals with AD.
              This journey acknowledges the urgency and complexity of addressing
              AD and emphasizes the need for creative solutions at the
              intersection of cognitive psychology and HCI. Drawing inspiration
              from the evolving landscape of research and technological
              advancements, anecdotes will be interwoven to provide a
              human-centric perspective on the challenges faced by AD patients
              and their caregivers. Through this overview, the aim is to
              establish the context for the exploration, highlighting the
              interconnectedness of cognitive psychology and HCI in addressing
              the multifaceted aspects of AD.

            <h2>/Article Summaries</h2>
            <p>
              The exploration of potential therapeutic benefits emerging from
              the convergence of video games and Alzheimer's disease (AD) serves
              as a focal point in contemporary research, integrating insights
              from cognitive psychology and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
              Within this context, the subsequent section contains summaries of
              four key articles spanning from 2007 to 2020. Each article
              presents distinctive perspectives on serious games, video
              game-based music therapy, and m-health gamification tailored to AD
              and dementia patients. These studies collectively contribute to a
              nuanced comprehension of the current landscape, elucidating the
              use of technology, particularly video games, to tackle cognitive
              challenges associated with AD. By synthesizing these articles, the
              objective is to unveil trends, identify existing gaps, and
              illuminate potential future directions in the development of
              effective interventions at the intersection of cognitive
              psychology and HCI.
            </p>

            <p>
              The paper by Benveniste et al. (2012) introduces MINWii, a serious
              video game tailored for Alzheimer's and dementia patients,
              focusing on music therapy. The innovative tool aims to enhance
              patients' self-image and alleviate behavioral symptoms through
              Wiimote-based gameplay, allowing participants to improvise or play
              predefined songs on a virtual keyboard. Despite ongoing
              development, the paper reports positive feedback from patients and
              caregivers, emphasizing MINWii's usability and potential impact.
              The design choices, including low cognitive and motor interface
              requirements, failure-free gameplay, and the use of off-the-shelf
              components, reflect the authors' commitment to simplicity to cater
              to varying skill levels among dementia patients. MINWii represents
              a valuable addition to non-pharmacological interventions, offering
              an engaging and accessible serious video game tailored to the
              unique needs of Alzheimer and dementia patients. Considering the
              future research, the focus on low cognitive requirements and
              failure-free gameplay in MINWii's design serves as a noteworthy
              precedent, prompting further exploration of these design
              principles in upcoming studies aimed at enhancing cognitive
              interventions for Alzheimer's patients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Baniqued et al.'s (2014) explores the potential cognitive benefits
              of casual video games and their transfer effects to untrained
              tasks. The study involved approximately 40 participants in each
              group and aimed to determine if playing casual video games could
              enhance various cognitive functions. The results indicated that
              playing games that specifically targeted working memory and
              reasoning demonstrated improvements in divided attention,
              particularly for individuals with lower initial reasoning ability.
              The study contributes to the existing literature on working memory
              and action video game training, highlighting the nuanced impact of
              casual video games on cognitive processes. Notably, the paper
              suggests that reasoning games are more effective in enhancing
              cognitive functions. This insight serves as a valuable
              consideration for future research, encouraging the utilization of
              reasoning games in upcoming studies aimed at further understanding
              and enhancing cognitive interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notably, both studies reveal a commonality in their design focus
              on single-player experiences, raising questions about the
              potential connection between loneliness and AD. Exploring this
              link, Wilson et al.’s (2007) longitudinal study establishes a
              clear association between loneliness and an elevated risk of
              developing AD, underscoring the critical role of emotional
              well-being in dementia risk. Inspired by the notion that emotional
              well-being plays a crucial role in dementia risk, the study aims
              to investigate interventions aimed at reducing loneliness as a
              potential means of alleviating memory loss severity in AD.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, to broaden the perspective beyond diagnosed
              individuals, an investigation into the interest of those aged 50
              and above in gamification therapy revealed insightful preferences.
              Tizuka et al.'s (2020) study on gamification rewards in m-health
              for adults 50+ emphasizes the importance of user engagement over
              the long term. For therapy to be effective, individuals must
              willingly participate in and enjoy the gaming experience. This
              insight aligns with the selection of a cooperative puzzle game
              genre for intervention. Cooperative puzzle games, with their
              inherent social interaction and problem-solving components, offer
              a promising avenue for enhancing user engagement in therapeutic
              settings. The cooperative puzzle genre, inspired by research
              findings, aims to provide an enjoyable and participatory platform
              for individuals, thereby contributing to the success of game-based
              interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To bridge these insights and address potential gaps, the next
              section proposes a new study that expands the focus to encompass
              preventive measures and explore the impact of social interactions
              and gamification on individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's
              Disease (AD).

            <h2>/Future Directions</h2>
            <p>
              In exploring the role of video games as potential tools for
              enhancing memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, the
              proposed research aims to investigate the intricate connection
              between video games and memory improvement within the AD context.
              Expanding on insights from existing studies, which predominantly
              focused on games designed for solo play, this envisioned research
              seeks to uncover the nuanced impacts associated with distinct
              gaming modalities. The study is structured to examine the
              differential effects of single-player experiences, multiplayer
              interactions with computer teammates, online multiplayer
              engagements, and local multiplayer dynamics on the memory
              functions of individuals contending with AD.
            </p>
            <h4>Game Selection</h4>
            <p>
              The Nintendo Switch platform is selected for this investigation,
              with a specific focus on the game "Snipperclips." This choice is
              based on the game's adaptability across solo, online, and local
              multiplayer settings. "Snipperclips" is recognized for its
              simplicity, low cognitive and motor requirements, and its
              classification as a reasoning game. Rather than selecting games
              designed explicitly for memory cognition training, the study
              purposefully opts for a broader exploration. The aim is to discern
              whether different multiplayer modalities, as offered by
              "Snipperclips," contribute to memory improvement in individuals
              diagnosed with AD.
            </p>
            <h4>Participant Inclusion Criteria</h4>
            <p>
              For participant qualification, the study targets individuals
              between the age 50 to 70, diagnosed with a mix of early or middle
              stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), possessing the cognitive capacity
              and willing to engage with video games. The study will involve
              random assignment of participants into six groups (See details in
              Methodology). Each group will consist of 10 participants, and the
              random assignment aims to balance potential confounding variables
              across the groups. This approach ensures that the impact of
              different gaming modalities on memory functions can be
              systematically evaluated within a diverse yet controlled
              participant pool.
            </p>
            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <p>
              The study employs a quasi-experimental design with a 8-week
              intervention period to investigate the impact of distinct gaming
              modalities on memory functions in individuals diagnosed with AD.
              Six groups will be formed, each comprising 10 participants:
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>A control group engaging in solo play</li>
                <li>A group playing with a computer teammate</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Half of the participants will be told their teammate is a
                    real player helping them with the therapy
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Half of the participants will be told their teammate is a
                    real player helping them with the therapy
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  A group playing virtually with a real player also diagnosed
                  with AD
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The participants will be told their teammate is also a
                    patient with AD and is also coping with the disease.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They will be paired to play in the same group during each
                    session.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  A group playing locally with a staff member player, helping
                  them with the therapy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A group playing locally with a real player also diagnosed with
                  AD.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              Participants in each group will play the Nintendo Switch game
              "Snipperclips" for thirty minutes per session, three times a week,
              in a home living room environment, adhering to a consistent
              schedule throughout the 8-week period. The frequency and duration
              of gameplay sessions are designed to strike a balance between
              ensuring meaningful engagement and preventing potential cognitive
              fatigue. Pre- and post-intervention assessments will be employed
              to quantify any changes in memory performance, allowing for a
              robust analysis of the potential efficacy of different gaming
              modalities in the context of AD.
            </p>
            <h4>Data Collection</h4>
            <p>
              As part of the data collection process, participants will undergo
              a brief survey both before and after engaging in gameplay sessions
              with 'Snipperclips.' The survey serves the dual purpose of gauging
              participants' mood and assessing memory-related aspects. Prior to
              playing the game, participants will respond to questions crafted
              to capture their initial emotional states. Following gameplay,
              participants will answer the same set of questions to record their
              final emotional states. Subsequently, a memory assessment, such as
              Mini-cog, will be administered, complemented by questions designed
              to discern potential variations in memory functions following
              gameplay. Examples of survey questions may include:
            </p>
            <div>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being extremely negative and 7
                  being extremely positive, how would you describe your current
                  mood?
                </li>
                <li>
                  On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being strongly disliked and 7
                  being strongly liked, how much do you enjoy the game?
                </li>
                <li>
                  On a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being extremely low and 7 being
                  extremely high, how would you rate your overall happiness
                  right now?
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              The data collected from participants' surveys and memory
              assessments will undergo a rigorous analysis to discern patterns
              and insights. Initial emotional states recorded before gameplay
              will be compared with final emotional states post-gameplay to
              identify any significant shifts. Additionally, memory-related
              responses will be analyzed to evaluate potential variations in
              memory functions following gameplay. The dataset, organized by
              participant groups, will be subjected to statistical methods to
              determine if there are noteworthy differences between groups.

            <h4>Limitations and Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              Focusing on the specific game 'Snipperclips' may limit
              generalization, and the small sample size of 10 participants per
              group may affect broader applicability. The 8-week timeframe
              offers insights into short-term effects, but long-term impacts may
              necessitate extended observation. Individual variability in gaming
              responses, influenced by factors like prior gaming exposure and
              cognitive differences, poses a challenge. Additionally, external
              factors affecting mood and memory functions outside the gaming
              environment present another challenge.

            <h2>/Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In conclusion, this proposed research endeavors to shed light on
              the intricate relationship between multiplayer gaming, mood, and
              memory functions among individuals with early and middle stage AD.
              By selecting the Nintendo Switch game 'Snipperclips' as a
              versatile tool adaptable to solo, online, and local multiplayer
              settings, this study aims to discern the differential impacts of
              these gaming modalities. The intentional focus on simplicity, low
              cognitive and motor requirements, and the game's classification as
              a reasoning game aligns with the goal of exploring interventions
              that transcend traditional boundaries. While potential limitations
              and challenges, such as the specific game choice and sample size,
              are acknowledged, the study aspires to offer tailored insights
              into the potential therapeutic benefits of multiplayer gaming for
              AD patients. By doing so, it contributes to the evolving landscape
              of innovative interventions for cognitive health, fostering a more
              comprehensive understanding of the role of video games in
              addressing the challenges posed by Alzheimer's disease.

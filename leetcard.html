              <h4>Technical Interview Prep Can Be Overwhelming...</h4>
              <p>
                Many developers struggle to efficiently refresh their memory on
                solved problems while preparing for technical interviews. This
                challenge is particularly pronounced during job hunting, where
                time is of the essence, and organization is critical.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common approach involves using Excel or spreadsheets to track
                and manage solved LeetCode problems. However, these tools are
                often inefficient, cumbersome, and not optimized for this
                specific purpose, leading to frustration and wasted time.

              <h4>LeetCard Embraces a Lean UX Approach</h4>
              <p>
                The design process for LeetCard follows a lean UX methodology.
                It began with researching whether users of LeetCode would find
                value in a flashcard app to enhance their study process. This
                approach allowed me to quickly validate the concept and
                determine the feasibility of moving forward with the project.

              <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
              <p>
                To understand the market landscape, I conducted a comprehensive
                competitive analysis of existing LeetCode study tools. This
                analysis allowed me to identify their strengths and weaknesses
                while uncovering opportunities for improvement. I discovered
                that many users were crafting their own solutions by combining
                different services or building their own tools, as there were no
                direct competitors fully addressing their needs. By analyzing
                the key components users relied on, I synthesized the most
                effective features from these solutions to create a cohesive and
                user-centric experience for our product.

                I created a persona to represent our target user, a software
                engineer who is preparing for technical interviews. This persona
                helped me understand the user's needs, goals, and pain points,
                guiding the design process to ensure the app would meet the
                user's expectations and provide value.

                incorporating core features that addressed the primary needs of
                our target audience. Initially, the plan included only the
                "Study Plan" and "All Cards" sections. However, as the project
                progressed, the team identified the critical importance of a
                "Profile Page." This addition allows users to securely save
                their data, alleviating concerns about potential content loss
                while enhancing the overall platform experience.

                The design system for this project was crafted entirely from
                scratch, without relying on pre-existing UI kits or libraries.
                This approach ensured a unique and tailored visual identity that
                aligned with the app's goals. The system was designed with
                scalability, consistency, and efficiency in mind, providing
                clear guidelines and reusable components. This foundation
                supports seamless collaboration and allows the product to evolve
                while maintaining quality and coherence.

                app's layout and functionality. Based on user needs, I
                implemented a bottom navigation bar to create a more intuitive
                experience. This decision was made to facilitate seamless
                navigation between the "Study Plan" and "All Cards" sections,
                particularly for users who frequently switch between these
                features while organizing their study plans.

                To expedite the release process, we launched the app without
                conducting traditional user testing. Instead, we focused on
                gathering real-world usage data to inform improvements. While
                user testing can provide valuable feedback, we prioritized swift
                market entry to gain a more authentic and comprehensive
                understanding of user behaviors and preferences. By monitoring
                user interactions and collecting feedback post-launch, we
                committed to an iterative process of refining the app, ensuring
                it meets the needs of our target audience and delivers a
                user-centric experience.

              <p>
                The iOS version launch generated an overwhelmingly positive
                response. Our developer shared the product on Reddit, where it
                received over 300 upvotes within a single day. This feedback
                highlighted strong demand for the app, with many users
                requesting an Android version, which is currently in
                development. Additionally, the expressed interest in a web
                version validated our roadmap and aligned with our future plans
                for platform expansion.

              While the app's launch was a success, achieving over 1,000
              downloads in the first two weeks and receiving praise for its
              aesthetic design and intuitive UI, we noticed that active user
              engagement fell short of expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this, we are focusing on the following future
              directions:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1. Enhancing Retention:</b><br />
              - Adding features to improve usability and encourage regular app
              usage.<br />
              - Refining the user experience based on behavioral data and user
              feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>2. Gathering Insights:</b><br />
              - Conducting user interviews to understand pain points and unmet
              needs.<br />
              - Iteratively updating the app to better align with user
              expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              With these initiatives, we aim to create a more comprehensive
              study tool tailored to the needs of software engineers and ensure
              sustained user engagement.

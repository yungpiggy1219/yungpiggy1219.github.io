            <h2>/Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Our project begin with the developer's own struggles with LeetCode
              while job hunting. Recognizing the need for a tool to
              <b>quickly refresh</b> memories on problems they've solved, we
              created a solution to help developers prepare efficiently for
              technical interviews.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, many individuals rely on Excel or spreadsheets to
              organize and track the LeetCode problems they've solved. However,
              these methods often lack efficiency and can be cumbersome to
              manage effectively. Our solution aims to streamline this process
              by providing a dedicated platform specifically tailored for
              organizing and tracking LeetCode problems, offering a more
              user-friendly and efficient alternative to traditional
              spreadsheet-based methods.

              <h2>/Design Process</h2>
              <p>
                The design process for LeetCard follows a
                <b>lean ux approach</b>. I began by researching whether people
                who use Leetcode would like to use a flashcard app to help them
                study. This help me quickly evaluate the idea and decide whether
                to move forward with the project.

              <h3>Think</h3>
              <p>
                I conducted a competitive analysis to identify the strengths and
                weaknesses of existing LeetCode study tools. This helped me
                understand the market landscape and identify opportunities for
                improvement. I found that users were crafting their own
                solutions by combining different available services, or build
                their own tools, rather than having direct competitors. I
                identified the key components users were utilizing. I then
                synthesized the most effective features from these services to
                create a cohesive user experience for our product.

              <h4>User Persona</h4>
              <p>
                I created a persona to represent our target user, a software
                engineer who is preparing for technical interviews. This persona
                helped me understand the user's needs, goals, and pain points,
                guiding the design process to ensure the app would meet the
                user's expectations and provide value.

                To keep the MVP simple, I focused on the core features that
                would provide the most value to users. The original plan was to
                include only the Study Plan and All Cards, however, as the
                project progressed, the developer decided a Profile page is
                critical for the MVP. This addition ensures users can securely
                save their data, mitigating concerns about content loss and
                enhancing the overall platform experience.

              />

              <h4>Mock-up</h4>
              <p>
                With the MVP in mind, I created prototypes to visualize the
                app's layout and functionality. With minor navication changes, I
                decided to utalize a bottom navigation bar to provide a more
                intuitive user experience. This design choice was made to ensure
                users could easily navigate between Study Plan and All Cards in
                case they wanted to switch between the two frequently when
                organizing their study plans.

                We decided to launch the app without conducting user testing,
                opting instead to rely on monitoring user usage data for
                insights to drive improvements. While traditional user testing
                offers valuable feedback, we believed that releasing the product
                to the market swiftly would provide us with real-world usage
                data and a more comprehensive understanding of user behaviors
                and preferences. By closely analyzing user interactions and
                feedback post-launch, we are committed to iteratively refining
                the app to enhance its usability and functionality, ensuring a
                user-centric experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the day of our iOS version launch, our developer took to
                Reddit to share news about our product, and the response was
                overwhelmingly positive, garnering over 300 upvotes within a
                single day. Many users requested an Android version, which is
                still a work in progress. Additionally, interest in a web
                version confirmed alignment with our future plans.

              Although the number of downloads was way higher than expected, the
              active users were lower than we anticipated. We are currently
              working on improving the app's retention rate by adding more
              features and enhancing the user experience. We are also planning
              to conduct user interviews to gather feedback and insights to
              further refine the app and ensure it meets the needs of our target
              users.
            </p>

            <p>
              The app had a successful launch, with over 1,000 downloads within
              the first two weeks. The app has been well-received by users, with
              many expressing their appreciation for the aesthetic design and
              user-friendly UI. We are excited to continue improving the app and
              expanding its features to provide a comprehensive study tool for
              software engineers.

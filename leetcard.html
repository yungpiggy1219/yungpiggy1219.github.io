              <h3>Technical Interview Prep Can Be Overwhelming...</h3>
              <div class="p-6 mt-4">
                <p>
                  LeetCode has become one of the most essential tools for
                  interview preparation, helping candidates sharpen their coding
                  skills through a vast collection of algorithmic challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, some developers prefer to thoroughly code out every
                  solution, while others take a conceptual approach, solving
                  problems mentally or using pseudocode to focus on patterns and
                  techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite these different approaches, many developers uses
                  spreadsheets or notes to track their progress, but these
                  methods still have their limitations. The goal of LeetCard is
                  to provide a more efficient and effective solution to this
                  problem.

              <h3>LeetCard Embraces a Lean UX Approach</h3>
              <p>
                The design process for LeetCard follows a lean UX methodology.
                It began with researching whether users of LeetCode would find
                value in a flashcard app to enhance their study process. This
                approach allowed me to quickly validate the concept and
                determine the feasibility of moving forward with the project.

              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p>
                To understand the market landscape, I conducted a comprehensive
                competitive analysis of existing LeetCode study tools. This
                analysis allowed me to identify their strengths and weaknesses
                while uncovering opportunities for improvement. Although there
                were no direct competitors to LeetCard, I found many indirect
                competitors that offered similar features.
              </p>

              <p>
                I discovered that many users were crafting their own solutions
                by combining different services or building their own tools, as
                there were no direct competitors fully addressing their needs.
                By analyzing the key components users relied on, I identified
                essential features to incorporate into our product. This
                informed the next step: conducting a task analysis to understand
                the user's workflow and key tasks.

                To understand the user’s experience and challenges in preparing
                for technical interviews, I mapped out a user journey of the
                LeetCode study process. This journey revealed key pain points,
                such as the inefficiency of manually tracking and recalling
                solved problems. By analyzing each stage—from solving problems
                to reviewing past solutions—I gained insights into user
                frustrations and opportunities for improvement, which directly
                informed the design of LeetCard’s core features.

                Defining Key Areas for Improvement

              <p>
                Competitive analysis, user journey mapping, and interviews
                revealed major challenges in how developers track and review
                LeetCode problems. Spreadsheets and notes are inefficient for
                quick recall and disrupts learning. Additionally, studying is
                restricted to desktop access, limiting flexibility. These

                To simplify the MVP and maximize user value, I focused on
                incorporating core features that addressed the primary needs of
                our target audience. Initially, the plan included only the
                "Study Plan" and "All Cards" sections. However, as the project
                progressed, the team identified the critical importance of a
                "Profile Page." This addition allows users to securely save
                their data, alleviating concerns about potential content loss
                while enhancing the overall platform experience.

              downloads in the first two weeks and receiving praise for its
              aesthetic design and intuitive UI, we noticed that active user
              engagement fell short of expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this, we are focusing on the following future
              directions:
            </p>

              usage.<br />
              - Refining the user experience based on behavioral data and user
              feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>2. Gathering Insights:</b><br />
              - Conducting user interviews to understand pain points and unmet
              needs.<br />
              - Iteratively updating the app to better align with user
              expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              With these initiatives, we aim to create a more comprehensive
              study tool tailored to the needs of software engineers and ensure
              sustained user engagement.

          <h2>What is LeetCode?</h2>
          <p>
            LeetCode is an online platform designed to help software engineers
            practice coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. It
            offers a vast collection of coding problems that cover data
            structures, algorithms, and system design concepts.

          <p>
            Through secondary research, I explored online forums, blog posts,
            and videos where developers shared their experiences studying
            LeetCode. This helped me uncover key pain points and strategies
            developers commonly use.
          </p>
          <h3>
            LeetCode’s web-only access limits developers' ability to review
            problems on the go
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many developers find it inconvenient that LeetCode practice requires
            access to a computer, making it difficult to review problems during
            downtime, such as commuting or waiting in line. This limitation
            hinders their ability to build consistent study habits and reinforce
            problem-solving strategies effectively.

            Revisiting previously solved problems helps developers reinforce
            problem-solving strategies by identifying patterns and improving
            their understanding. This process allows them to internalize key
            concepts, making it easier to apply similar approaches to new

            I discovered that many users were crafting their own solutions by
            combining different services or building their own tools, as there
            were no direct competitors fully addressing their needs. By
            analyzing the key components users relied on, I identified essential
            features to incorporate into our product. This informed the next
            step: conducting a task analysis to understand the user's workflow
            and key tasks.

            inefficiency of manually tracking and recalling solved problems. By
            analyzing each stage from solving problems to reviewing past
            solutions, I gained insights into user frustrations and
            opportunities for improvement, which directly informed the design of
            LeetCard’s core features.

          <p>
            Competitive analysis, user journey mapping, and interviews revealed
            major challenges in how developers track and review LeetCode
            problems. Spreadsheets and notes are inefficient for quick recall
            and disrupts learning. Additionally, studying is restricted to
            desktop access, limiting flexibility. These insights shaped the core
            design features to enhance accessibility, recall efficiency, and
            engagement.
          </p>
          <h3>Enable Study on the Go</h3>
          <p>
            A mobile-first experience allows users to review and reinforce
            problem-solving strategies on the go, fitting study sessions into
            daily routines.
          </p>

          <h3>Replace Manual Problem Searching with Randomized Recall</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of manually selecting problems to review, a quiz-like recall
            mode can surface problems dynamically, reducing decision fatigue.
            Spaced repetition can help reinforce weaker areas by resurfacing
            problems strategically.
          </p>

          <h3>Focus on Solutions with Predefined LeetCode Problems</h3>
          <p>
            The app will predefine LeetCode problems, so users only need to
            input their solutions—eliminating manual entry. If users don’t have
            a solution, AI-powered assistance can provide hints or generate
            example solutions to aid learning.

          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            To simplify the MVP and maximize user value, I focused on
            incorporating core features that addressed the primary needs of our
            target audience. I mapped out the main user flow for LeetCard, which
            covers starting a study session, progressing through problems, and
            completing the session. This flow includes key decision points, such
            as allowing users to exit mid-session with the choice to save or
            discard progress.

          <h3>Content Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            First, I used content mapping to organize key features and
            information within LeetCard based on the app’s core user flow. I
            began by identifying the primary actions users take, such as
            selecting a study plan, starting a session, and reviewing progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            From there, I grouped related content into distinct categories:
            Study Plan, Cards, Profile, and app related settings. This method
            allowed me to establish a clear information structure that aligns
            with user goals, ensuring content is intuitive and easy to navigate.

            Using the grouped content from my content mapping process, I
            translated the structure into a clear information architecture that
            supports key user actions. Each content group became a core section
            in the app. This structured IA ensures the app’s layout aligns with
            user goals, streamlining navigation and enhancing the overall study
            experience.

          <p>
            Keeping the MVP in mind, I developed prototypes to visualize the
            app's layout and functionality. Based on user needs, I implemented a
            bottom navigation bar to create a more intuitive experience. This
            decision was made to facilitate seamless navigation between the
            "Study Plan" and "All Cards" sections, particularly for users who
            frequently switch between these features while organizing their
            study plans.

            I began developing the design system once the prototype had taken
            shape to ensure consistency, efficiency, and maintainability across
            the LeetCard app. Since the UI designs were all unique, establishing
            a cohesive system was essential to unify visual elements,
            interactions, and patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design system defines key components such as buttons, cards,
            color schemes, and typography, providing clear guidelines and
            reusable elements. This scalable foundation not only streamlines
            development but also ensures future updates and new features

            While the app's launch was a success, achieving over 1,000 downloads
            in the first two weeks and receiving praise for its aesthetic design
            and intuitive UI, we noticed that active user engagement fell short
            of expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address this, we are focusing on the following future directions:
          </p>
          <p><b>1. Enhancing Retention:</b></p>
          <p>
            - Adding features to improve usability and encourage regular app
            usage.<br />- Refining the user experience based on behavioral data
            and user feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Gathering Insights:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            - Conducting user interviews to understand pain points and unmet
            needs.<br />- Iteratively updating the app to better align with user
            expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            With these initiatives, we aim to create a more comprehensive study
            tool tailored to the needs of software engineers and ensure
            sustained user engagement.

            <h2>Technical Interview Prep Can Be Overwhelming...</h2>

            <p>
              LeetCode has become one of the most essential tools for interview
              preparation, helping candidates sharpen their coding skills
              through a vast collection of algorithmic challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some developers prefer to thoroughly code out every solution,
              while others take a conceptual approach, solving problems mentally
              or using pseudocode to focus on patterns and techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these different approaches, many developers uses
              spreadsheets or notes to track their progress, but these methods
              still have their limitations. The goal of LeetCard is to provide a
              more efficient and effective solution to this problem.

          <h2>What is LeetCode?</h2>
          <p>
            LeetCode is an online platform designed to help software engineers
            practice coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. It
            offers a vast collection of coding problems that cover data
            structures, algorithms, and system design concepts.

        <div class="container textContainer">
          <h5 class="accentTitle">/Problem Breakdown</h5>
          <p>
            Through secondary research, I explored online forums, blog posts,
            and videos where developers shared their experiences studying
            LeetCode. This helped me uncover key pain points and strategies
            developers commonly use.
          </p>
          <h3>
            LeetCode’s web-only access limits developers' ability to review
            problems on the go
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many developers find it inconvenient that LeetCode practice requires
            access to a computer, making it difficult to review problems during
            downtime, such as commuting or waiting in line. This limitation
            hinders their ability to build consistent study habits and reinforce
            problem-solving strategies effectively.
          </p>
          <img
            src="assets/img/LCQuote1.png"
            alt="Wouldn't a mobile app be incredibly useful for practicing LeetCode problems on the go, whether you're outdoors, stuck in traffic, commuting, or sitting anywhere away from your desk?"
            class="img-fluid"
          />
          <h3>
            Reviewing past problems is crucial for reinforcing problem-solving
            strategies
          </h3>
          <p>
            Revisiting previously solved problems helps developers reinforce
            problem-solving strategies by identifying patterns and improving
            their understanding. This process allows them to internalize key
            concepts, making it easier to apply similar approaches to new
            challenges.

            class="img-fluid"
          />
          <h3>
            Many developers use spreadsheets or note-taking apps to track solved
            problems
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many developers rely on spreadsheets or note-taking apps to track
            solved problems. While this method helps with organization, it often
            lacks structure for effective review. As one developer shared, they
            used a spreadsheet to track completed problems but also wanted to
            revisit them later to reinforce their understanding and memory.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            To understand the market landscape, I conducted a comprehensive
            competitive analysis of existing LeetCode study tools. This analysis
            allowed me to identify their strengths and weaknesses while
            uncovering opportunities for improvement. Although there were no
            direct competitors to LeetCard, I found many indirect competitors
            that offered similar features.

          <h4 style="font-weight: 700">Direct Competitors</h4>
          <p>
            I discovered that many users were crafting their own solutions by
            combining different services or building their own tools, as there
            were no direct competitors fully addressing their needs. By
            analyzing the key components users relied on, I identified essential
            features to incorporate into our product. This informed the next
            step: conducting a task analysis to understand the user's workflow
            and key tasks.
          </p>
          <h2>User Journey</h2>
          <p>
            To understand the user’s experience and challenges in preparing for
            technical interviews, I mapped out a user journey of the LeetCode
            study process. This journey revealed key pain points, such as the
            inefficiency of manually tracking and recalling solved problems. By
            analyzing each stage from solving problems to reviewing past
            solutions, I gained insights into user frustrations and
            opportunities for improvement, which directly informed the design of
            LeetCard’s core features.

          <p>
            Competitive analysis, user journey mapping, and interviews revealed
            major challenges in how developers track and review LeetCode
            problems. Spreadsheets and notes are inefficient for quick recall
            and disrupts learning. Additionally, studying is restricted to
            desktop access, limiting flexibility. These insights shaped the core
            design features to enhance accessibility, recall efficiency, and
            engagement.

          <h3>Enable Study on the Go</h3>
          <p>
            A mobile-first experience allows users to review and reinforce
            problem-solving strategies on the go, fitting study sessions into
            daily routines.

          <h3>Replace Manual Problem Searching with Randomized Recall</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of manually selecting problems to review, a quiz-like recall
            mode can surface problems dynamically, reducing decision fatigue.
            Spaced repetition can help reinforce weaker areas by resurfacing
            problems strategically.
          </p>

          <h3>Focus on Solutions with Predefined LeetCode Problems</h3>
          <p>
            The app will predefine LeetCode problems, so users only need to
            input their solutions—eliminating manual entry. If users don’t have
            a solution, AI-powered assistance can provide hints or generate
            example solutions to aid learning.

          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            To simplify the MVP and maximize user value, I focused on
            incorporating core features that addressed the primary needs of our
            target audience. I mapped out the main user flow for LeetCard, which
            covers starting a study session, progressing through problems, and
            completing the session. This flow includes key decision points, such
            as allowing users to exit mid-session with the choice to save or
            discard progress.

          <h3>Content Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            First, I used content mapping to organize key features and
            information within LeetCard based on the app’s core user flow. I
            began by identifying the primary actions users take, such as
            selecting a study plan, starting a session, and reviewing progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            From there, I grouped related content into distinct categories:
            Study Plan, Cards, Profile, and app related settings. This method
            allowed me to establish a clear information structure that aligns
            with user goals, ensuring content is intuitive and easy to navigate.

      <section class="section">
        <div class="container textContainer">
          <p>
            Using the grouped content from my content mapping process, I
            translated the structure into a clear information architecture that
            supports key user actions. Each content group became a core section
            in the app. This structured IA ensures the app’s layout aligns with
            user goals, streamlining navigation and enhancing the overall study
            experience.

          <h3>Prototypes and Navigation Design</h3>
          <p>
            Keeping the MVP in mind, I developed prototypes to visualize the
            app's layout and functionality. Based on user needs, I implemented a
            bottom navigation bar to create a more intuitive experience. This
            decision was made to facilitate seamless navigation between the
            "Study Plan" and "All Cards" sections, particularly for users who
            frequently switch between these features while organizing their
            study plans.

          <h5 class="accentTitle">/Design System</h5>
          <p>
            I began developing the design system once the prototype had taken
            shape to ensure consistency, efficiency, and maintainability across
            the LeetCard app. Since the UI designs were all unique, establishing
            a cohesive system was essential to unify visual elements,
            interactions, and patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design system defines key components such as buttons, cards,
            color schemes, and typography, providing clear guidelines and
            reusable elements. This scalable foundation not only streamlines
            development but also ensures future updates and new features
            maintain a consistent user experience.

          <p>
            To expedite the release process, we launched the app without
            conducting traditional user testing. Instead, we focused on
            gathering real-world usage data to inform improvements. While user
            testing can provide valuable feedback, we prioritized swift market
            entry to gain a more authentic and comprehensive understanding of
            user behaviors and preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            By monitoring user interactions and collecting feedback post-launch,
            we committed to an iterative process of refining the app, ensuring
            it meets the needs of our target audience and delivers a
            user-centric experience.

            The iOS version launch generated an overwhelmingly positive
            response. Our developer shared the product on Reddit, where it
            received over 300 upvotes within a single day. This feedback
            highlighted strong demand for the app, with many users requesting an
            Android version, which is currently in development. Additionally,
            the expressed interest in a web version validated our roadmap and
            aligned with our future plans for platform expansion.

          <h5 class="accentTitle">/Future Directions</h5>
          <h3>How Can We Improve Retention and Engagement?</h3>
          <p>
            While the app's launch was a success, achieving over 1,000 downloads
            in the first two weeks and receiving praise for its aesthetic design
            and intuitive UI, we noticed that active user engagement fell short
            of expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address this, we are focusing on the following future directions:
          </p>
          <p><b>1. Enhancing Retention:</b></p>
          <p>
            - Adding features to improve usability and encourage regular app
            usage.</br>- Refining the user experience based on behavioral data
            and user feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Gathering Insights:</b>
          </p>
          <p>- Conducting user interviews to understand pain points and unmet needs.</br>- Iteratively updating the app to better align with user expectations.</p>
          <p>
            With these initiatives, we aim to create a more comprehensive study tool tailored to the needs of software engineers and ensure sustained user engagement.

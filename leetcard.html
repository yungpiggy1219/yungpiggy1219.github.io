            <h2>/Problem</h2>
            <p>
              The motivation behind embarking on this project originates from my
              frustration in searching for a reliable Pokedex app on my mobile
              device. Despite the abundance of options, each app presented
              issues such as
              <b>outdated information</b>, <b>frequent crashes</b>,
              <b>unattractive user interfaces</b>, and
              <b>convoluted user flows</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This collective set of problems left a noticeable gap in the
              market for a comprehensive and user-friendly Pokedex application.
              This challenge resonates with fellow enthusiasts who, like myself,
              desire a seamless and efficient means to explore and catalog
              Pokemon information while on the go. It is this persistent issue
              that fueled my determination to create a Pokedex application,
              aiming not only to address these existing shortcomings but also to
              deliver an enhanced user experience, positioning it as the primary
              resource for Pokemon enthusiasts worldwide.

            <h2>/Design Process</h2>
            <p>
              As part of the process, I reviewed the designs of existing PokéDex
              <b>websites</b> and <b>apps</b>. This helped me identify design
              strengths and weaknesses of existing products and served as a
              foundation for developing our unique design.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used these insights to create initial wireframes and prototypes.
              Through an iterative process, I continuously improved the design
              based on design reviews. This allowed us to refine the interface
              and ensure it aligned with user preferences.

            <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              I evaluated the user experiences of competitors' products to
              identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. I analyzed
              competitor features, design choices, and overall strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most common issues I found include <b>outdated information</b>,
              <b>frequent crashes</b>, <b>unattractive user interfaces</b>,
              <b>poor information architecture</b>, and
              <b>convoluted user flows</b>. These problems created a demand for
              a more reliable and aesthetically pleasing Pokédex app.
            </p>
            <div class="mb-4">
              <img
                src="assets/img/compReview.png"

                class="img-fluid"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              The poor information architecture in these apps often led to a
              frustrating user experience. Users found it difficult to locate
              the specific information they needed, such as detailed Pokémon
              statistics, evolutions, and move sets. The lack of a coherent
              structure within the apps meant that players had to spend an
              inordinate amount of time navigating through cluttered menus and
              confusing categories. This not only hampered their gameplay but
              also made the overall experience less enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, the convoluted user flows in these existing Pokédex apps
              exacerbated the problem. Simple tasks like searching for a
              Pokémon, viewing its abilities, or accessing its location in the
              game world became time-consuming and counterintuitive. Players
              often found themselves lost in a maze of menus, and the lack of a
              logical progression in their interactions with the app made it
              challenging to achieve their objectives efficiently.

            <h4>User Archetypes</h4>
            <p>
              I created user archetypes to help me understand the needs and
              motivations of our target audience. This allowed me to identify
              the key features and functionalities that would be most valuable
              to our users. identified several key players in the Pokémon app
              space. For example, "PokéGuide" offered comprehensive information
              on Pokémon, types, and evolutions but suffered from an outdated
              user interface and frequent crashes. This analysis guided our
              design decisions by highlighting the need for a reliable and
              visually appealing app. Based on our competitor research, we
              identified two distinct user categories:

            <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
            <p>
              To design an effective information architecture (IA) for our
              product, I aligning our design decisions with the needs and
              expectations of our users. I meticulously organized the collected
              data to inform the development of our IA framework.
            </p>

            <p>
              To accomodate the needs of both casual and hardcore players, I
              categorized the app by type. This structure allowed users to
              easily access the information they needed, whether they were
              looking for basic Pokémon data or information about a specific
              ability.

            <h4>Wireframing</h4>
            <p>
              After carefully considering the needs of our users, I created a
              set of wireframes to visualize the app's layout and functionality.
              These wireframes served as a blueprint for the app's design and
              helped us to identify potential issues early in the design
              process.

              to quickly find the information they needed.

            <p>
              A significant challenge during the project was aligning our design
              vision with the technical feasibility. Open and honest
              communication between the UI/UX Designer (myself) and the iOS
              Developer was essential in finding common ground. We resolved this
              by prioritizing features based on user needs and technical
              constraints.

            <p>
              It is important to note that the app's design decisions were
              heavily influenced by the technical constraints of the iOS
              platform and the capability of the developer. This required a high
              level of collaboration and communication with the Developer to
              ensure that the final product was both visually appealing and
              technically feasible.

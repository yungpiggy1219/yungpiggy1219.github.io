            <h2>Catching ‘em all shouldn’t be this frustrating...</h2>

            <p>
              As a dedicated Pokémon enthusiast, I often found myself relying on
              online Pokédex tools to look up stats, abilities, and evolution
              paths. While there are several excellent Pokédex websites
              available, finding a reliable mobile app that offers the same
              depth of information and usability has been surprisingly
              difficult. Many existing Pokédex apps suffer from <b>outdated data</b>,
              <b>clunky interfaces</b>, <b>frequent crashes</b>, or <b>confusing navigation</b>,
              making it frustrating for trainers who need quick and accurate
              information while on the go.
            </p>
            <p>
              This gap in the mobile app space inspired me to create MonsterDex,
              a streamlined, user-friendly app designed to bring the reliability
              and depth of top-tier Pokédex websites to mobile devices. With
              accurate data, intuitive navigation, and an engaging interface,
              MonsterDex aims to be the ultimate resource for Pokémon trainers
              worldwide.

          <h2>What is LeetCode?</h2>
          <p>
            LeetCode is an online platform designed to help software engineers
            practice coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. It
            offers a vast collection of coding problems that cover data
            structures, algorithms, and system design concepts.

          <h5 class="accentTitle">/Problem Breakdown</h5>
          <p>
            Through secondary research, I explored online forums, blog posts,
            and videos where developers shared their experiences studying
            LeetCode. This helped me uncover key pain points and strategies
            developers commonly use.
          </p>
          <h3>
            LeetCode’s web-only access limits developers' ability to review
            problems on the go
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many developers find it inconvenient that LeetCode practice requires
            access to a computer, making it difficult to review problems during
            downtime, such as commuting or waiting in line. This limitation
            hinders their ability to build consistent study habits and reinforce
            problem-solving strategies effectively.

          <p>
            Revisiting previously solved problems helps developers reinforce
            problem-solving strategies by identifying patterns and improving
            their understanding. This process allows them to internalize key
            concepts, making it easier to apply similar approaches to new
            challenges.

            Many developers rely on spreadsheets or note-taking apps to track
            solved problems. While this method helps with organization, it often
            lacks structure for effective review. As one developer shared, they
            used a spreadsheet to track completed problems but also wanted to
            revisit them later to reinforce their understanding and memory.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            To understand the market landscape, I conducted a comprehensive
            competitive analysis of existing LeetCode study tools. This analysis
            allowed me to identify their strengths and weaknesses while
            uncovering opportunities for improvement. Although there were no
            direct competitors to LeetCard, I found many indirect competitors
            that offered similar features.

          <h4 style="font-weight: 700">Direct Competitors</h4>
          <p>
            I discovered that many users were crafting their own solutions by
            combining different services or building their own tools, as there
            were no direct competitors fully addressing their needs. By
            analyzing the key components users relied on, I identified essential
            features to incorporate into our product. This informed the next
            step: conducting a task analysis to understand the user's workflow
            and key tasks.

            inefficiency of manually tracking and recalling solved problems. By
            analyzing each stage from solving problems to reviewing past
            solutions, I gained insights into user frustrations and
            opportunities for improvement, which directly informed the design of
            LeetCard’s core features.

          <p>
            Competitive analysis, user journey mapping, and interviews revealed
            major challenges in how developers track and review LeetCode
            problems. Spreadsheets and notes are inefficient for quick recall
            and disrupts learning. Additionally, studying is restricted to
            desktop access, limiting flexibility. These insights shaped the core
            design features to enhance accessibility, recall efficiency, and
            engagement.
          </p>
          <h3>Enable Study on the Go</h3>
          <p>
            A mobile-first experience allows users to review and reinforce
            problem-solving strategies on the go, fitting study sessions into
            daily routines.
          </p>

          <h3>Replace Manual Problem Searching with Randomized Recall</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of manually selecting problems to review, a quiz-like recall
            mode can surface problems dynamically, reducing decision fatigue.
            Spaced repetition can help reinforce weaker areas by resurfacing
            problems strategically.
          </p>

          <h3>Focus on Solutions with Predefined LeetCode Problems</h3>
          <p>
            The app will predefine LeetCode problems, so users only need to
            input their solutions—eliminating manual entry. If users don’t have
            a solution, AI-powered assistance can provide hints or generate
            example solutions to aid learning.

          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            To simplify the MVP and maximize user value, I focused on
            incorporating core features that addressed the primary needs of our
            target audience. I mapped out the main user flow for LeetCard, which
            covers starting a study session, progressing through problems, and
            completing the session. This flow includes key decision points, such
            as allowing users to exit mid-session with the choice to save or
            discard progress.

          <h3>Content Mapping</h3>
          <p>
            First, I used content mapping to organize key features and
            information within LeetCard based on the app’s core user flow. I
            began by identifying the primary actions users take, such as
            selecting a study plan, starting a session, and reviewing progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            From there, I grouped related content into distinct categories:
            Study Plan, Cards, Profile, and app related settings. This method
            allowed me to establish a clear information structure that aligns
            with user goals, ensuring content is intuitive and easy to navigate.

            Using the grouped content from my content mapping process, I
            translated the structure into a clear information architecture that
            supports key user actions. Each content group became a core section
            in the app. This structured IA ensures the app’s layout aligns with
            user goals, streamlining navigation and enhancing the overall study
            experience.

          <p>
            Keeping the MVP in mind, I developed prototypes to visualize the
            app's layout and functionality. Based on user needs, I implemented a
            bottom navigation bar to create a more intuitive experience. This
            decision was made to facilitate seamless navigation between the
            "Study Plan" and "All Cards" sections, particularly for users who
            frequently switch between these features while organizing their
            study plans.

            I began developing the design system once the prototype had taken
            shape to ensure consistency, efficiency, and maintainability across
            the LeetCard app. Since the UI designs were all unique, establishing
            a cohesive system was essential to unify visual elements,
            interactions, and patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design system defines key components such as buttons, cards,
            color schemes, and typography, providing clear guidelines and
            reusable elements. This scalable foundation not only streamlines
            development but also ensures future updates and new features

          <h3>How Can We Improve Retention and Engagement?</h3>
          <p>
            While the app's launch was a success, achieving over 1,000 downloads
            in the first two weeks and receiving praise for its aesthetic design
            and intuitive UI, we noticed that active user engagement fell short
            of expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address this, we are focusing on the following future directions:
          </p>
          <p><b>1. Enhancing Retention:</b></p>
          <p>
            - Adding features to improve usability and encourage regular app
            usage.<br />- Refining the user experience based on behavioral data
            and user feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Gathering Insights:</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            - Conducting user interviews to understand pain points and unmet
            needs.<br />- Iteratively updating the app to better align with user
            expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            With these initiatives, we aim to create a more comprehensive study
            tool tailored to the needs of software engineers and ensure
            sustained user engagement.

                I started by exploring the user journey to understand the user
                interaction from playing the game, to identifying missing
                information, searching for specific Pokémon, understanding the
                information, and then returning to the game. This helped me to
                identify the key touchpoints and pain points in the user
                journey. I used this information to inform the design of the app
                and ensure that it met the needs of our users at every stage of
                their interaction with the app.

                I evaluated the user experiences of competitors' products to
                identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. I analyzed
                competitor features, design choices, and overall strategies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most common issues I found include
                <b>outdated information</b>, <b>frequent crashes</b>,
                <b>unattractive user interfaces</b>,
                <b>poor information architecture</b>, and
                <b>convoluted user flows</b>. These problems created a demand
                for a more reliable and aesthetically pleasing Pokédex app.

              </div>
              <p>
                The poor information architecture in these apps often led to a
                frustrating user experience. Users found it difficult to locate
                the specific information they needed, such as detailed Pokémon
                statistics, evolutions, and move sets. The lack of a coherent
                structure within the apps meant that players had to spend an
                inordinate amount of time navigating through cluttered menus and
                confusing categories. This not only hampered their gameplay but
                also made the overall experience less enjoyable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, the convoluted user flows in these existing Pokédex
                apps exacerbated the problem. Simple tasks like searching for a
                Pokémon, viewing its abilities, or accessing its location in the
                game world became time-consuming and counterintuitive. Players
                often found themselves lost in a maze of menus, and the lack of
                a logical progression in their interactions with the app made it
                challenging to achieve their objectives efficiently.

                I identified the key features and functionalities that would be
                most valuable to our users. This allowed me to prioritize the
                development of features that would have the greatest impact on
                the user experience. A list of user requirements was created to
                guide the development of the app. These requirements were based
                on the needs and preferences of our target audience and were
                used to inform the design of the app.
              </p>

              <p>
                The user requirements were organized into two categories:
                essential and desirable. Essential requirements were features
                that were critical to the app's functionality and were necessary
                for the app to be successful. Desirable requirements were
                features that would enhance the user experience but were not
                essential for the app to function.

            <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
            <p>
              To design an effective information architecture (IA) for our
              product, I aligned our design decisions with the needs and
              expectations of our users. I meticulously organized the collected
              data to inform the development of our IA framework.
            </p>

            <p>
              To accommodate the needs of both casual and hardcore players, I
              categorized the app by type. This structure allowed users to
              easily access the information they needed, whether they were
              looking for basic Pokémon data or information about a specific
              ability.

            <h4>Wireframing</h4>
            <p>
              After carefully considering the needs of our users, I created a
              set of wireframes to visualize the app's layout and functionality.
              These wireframes served as a blueprint for the app's design and
              helped us to identify potential issues early in the design
              process.

              The use of a hamburger menu allowed us to maintain a clean and
              uncluttered interface, while still providing access to all of the
              app's features. A search function was also included to allow users
              to quickly find the information they needed.

            <p>
              A significant challenge during the project was aligning our design
              vision with the technical feasibility. Open and honest
              communication between the UI/UX Designer (myself) and the iOS
              Developer was essential in finding common ground. We resolved this
              by prioritizing features based on user needs and technical
              constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to note that the app's design decisions were
              heavily influenced by the technical constraints of the iOS
              platform and the capability of the developer. This required a high
              level of collaboration and communication with the Developer to
              ensure that the final product was both visually appealing and
              technically feasible.

            <h2>/Problem</h2>
            <p>
              The motivation behind embarking on this project originates from my
              frustration in searching for a reliable Pokedex app on my mobile
              device. Despite the abundance of options, each app presented
              issues such as
              <b>outdated information</b>, <b>frequent crashes</b>,
              <b>unattractive user interfaces</b>,
              <b>poor information architecture</b>, and
              <b>convoluted user flows</b>. This collective set of problems left
              a noticeable gap in the market for a comprehensive and
              user-friendly Pokedex application. This challenge resonates with
              fellow enthusiasts who, like myself, desire a seamless and
              efficient means to explore and catalog Pokemon information while
              on the go. It is this persistent issue that fueled my
              determination to create a Pokedex application, aiming not only to
              address these existing shortcomings but also to deliver an
              enhanced user experience, positioning it as the primary resource
              for Pokemon enthusiasts worldwide.

            <h2>/Design Process</h2>
            <p>
              As part of the process, I reviewed the designs of existing PokéDex
              websites and apps. This helped me identify design strengths and
              weaknesses and served as a foundation for developing our unique
              design.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used these insights to create initial wireframes and prototypes.
              Through an iterative process, we continuously improved the design
              based on user feedback and design reviews. This allowed us to
              refine the interface and ensure it aligned with user preferences.

            <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              I evaluated the user experiences of competitors' products to
              identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. I analyzed
              competitor features, design choices, and overall strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most common issues I found include <b>outdated information</b>,
              <b>frequent crashes</b>, <b>unattractive user interfaces</b>,
              <b>poor information architecture</b>, and
              <b>convoluted user flows</b>. These problems created a demand for
              a more reliable and aesthetically pleasing Pokédex app.
            </p>
            <div class="mb-4">
              <img
                src="assets/img/compReview.png"
                alt="Image"
                class="img-fluid"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              The poor information architecture in these apps often led to a
              frustrating user experience. Users found it difficult to locate
              the specific information they needed, such as detailed Pokémon
              statistics, evolutions, and move sets. The lack of a coherent
              structure within the apps meant that players had to spend an
              inordinate amount of time navigating through cluttered menus and
              confusing categories. This not only hampered their gameplay but
              also made the overall experience less enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, the convoluted user flows in these existing Pokédex apps
              exacerbated the problem. Simple tasks like searching for a
              Pokémon, viewing its abilities, or accessing its location in the
              game world became time-consuming and counterintuitive. Players
              often found themselves lost in a maze of menus, and the lack of a
              logical progression in their interactions with the app made it
              challenging to achieve their objectives efficiently.

            <h4>User Archetypes</h4>
            <p>
              I created user archetypes to help me understand the needs and
              motivations of our target audience. This allowed me to identify
              the key features and functionalities that would be most valuable
              to our users. identified several key players in the Pokémon app
              space. For example, "PokéGuide" offered comprehensive information
              on Pokémon, types, and evolutions but suffered from an outdated
              user interface and frequent crashes. This analysis guided our
              design decisions by highlighting the need for a reliable and
              visually appealing app. Based on our competitor research, we
              identified two distinct user categories:

            <p>
              A significant challenge during the project was aligning our design
              vision with the technical feasibility. Open and honest
              communication between the UI/UX Designer (myself) and the iOS
              Developer was essential in finding common ground. We resolved this
              by prioritizing features based on user needs and technical
              constraints.
